In openCV, the axese are

 (0,0)------> X axis

 v
 Y axis

 * The channels are color channels such as Green, Blue, Red
 * First real-time detection method was done by Viola and Jones
        - OpenCV uses cascades (trained models in XML format) eyes, trees, frontalface,
          fullbody, etc
        - We can also create custom cascade and import.

 * Virtual Paint Project Procedure
 1. Remove the color(s) with specific color HSVs and mask them (removing the noise of other colors)
 2. Detect the shape and area of the stick or controller (get contour)
 3. Get points - x and y for the movement of contour and fill colors.
 4. For multiple colors, perform loop for a list with multiple color HSVs and values in the place of a single
    color.
